      Exception Handling
----------------------------------------------------


There are 3 types of Exception :::

* Syntax Errors (Compile time): Due to lack of proper syntax, this kind of
exception occurs.

* Logical Errors : This will occur whenever user is getting
different output from what he/she expecting. so, we need to change the logic,
then we can fic it.

* Run-time errors : During execution of the program will be terminated in the middle itself.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
     Exception handling is a mechanism to handle Runtime errors.

The THREE things important things, we need to remember while developing program.

        1. Comments, Naming convention/Indentation/Coding std
        2. Excecptioin Handling
        3. Validation on Data

* All exceptions in java are classes which are inherited from a base class called 'Exception'.

        1. try : The code which you are writing indisde try will be checked by the compiler
            and if detects any issue it will redirect to catch.

        2. catch : It is going to handle the exception.

        3. finally : It's an optional block. but the code inside finally will be executed
                    irrespective of the Exception.
        4. throw : To raise Exception explicitly then we use it.
                    generally we use it in user-defined Exception.
        5. throws : To handle Exception for a specific method to handle it implicitly.

                e.g. - public static void main (String[] args) {
                    throws IOException{}
                }
