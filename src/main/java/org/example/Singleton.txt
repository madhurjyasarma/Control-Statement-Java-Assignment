In singleton - one object is created, and it is maintained throughout the execution of the program.
Singleton design pattern is used in database connectivity, caching, socket programming.


-- Multi-threading
In order to create a thread safe application, we need to add synchronize keyword.
* main is a thread.
- If we create 2 objects, 3 thread is being maintained. ObjOne, Objtwo and main.


--- For each example -

// list consists of different objects like String, float, int, boolean etc.
for (Object item : list) {
    sout(item);
}


Object listArray[] = listItem.toArray();
